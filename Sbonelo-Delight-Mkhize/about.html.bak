				<center><h3>Back Story</h3>
					<p>Born and bred in the province of KwaZulu Natal; in a small mission-like place called <strong>Amandawe</strong>, near the town of Scottsburgh,<br/> I grew up hearding cows, like other boys my age.  From an early age, I showed signs of creativity<br/> and my mind has been buzzing with ideads ever since. <br/>
					<h3>...</h3>By the the time I had reach highschool, I had made up my mind about the career I would venture into- I was gonna be an <strong>Animator</strong>.<br/> I honesty could not imagine myself doing anything else. At this time, my drawing had improved really well, teachers noticed and would encourage me to enter art competitions. In my matric year, i fell inlove with writing after taking those reading 'The Merchant of Venice'. This love for writing, together with a naturally creative mind, led me to study a BA degree in the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal.<br/> Everything was going well, untill i was hit with the harsh reality of not being able to complete my studies due to financial defficulties. I had to drop out of university in 2015, right when i was doing my second year.<br/> 
					<h3>...</h3>Realising that my chance of obtaining a degree had shrunk dramatically, I began looking for jobs, During my time in a call center job at 'The Unlimited', I met this 'nerdy' guy who introduced me to coding. I fell inlove with it ever since. Now I can honestly say i dont see myself doing anything else other than coding. It encoporates EVERY aspect of creativity i have, in a more sophisticaed way. <strong><m>UMUZI</m></strong> now remains the only hope I have in obtaining a qualification. Please take me in this Learnership programme. <h3>...</h3>I forsee a future that has a work envoroment that is heavily dominated by robots and Artificial intelligence, <br/> In that future, i see people in that tech field working hand in hand with this technology.<br/>I want to be part of those people<br/><m>S.D Mkhize</m></p></center>
